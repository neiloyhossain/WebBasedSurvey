        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="accordion">How is AI used to give me my results?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>That is a good question! When you hit submit on the survey, your responses are sent to ChatGPT along with a prompt
                    containing the questions of the survey. ChatGPT then analyzes it and returns your very own
                    personalized results. Each result is unique to the individual who took the survey, so no two results are the same.
