This project is a Node.js server that serves a web-based survey application. 
The survey application includes client-side JavaScript for interactive features
 and connects to an OpenAI API endpoint to process survey results.

 Prerequisites
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.

All the files should be on your machine by keeping up to date with the pull requests on the branches
in github. Once that is all up to date you can start your localhost on your machine by using this
 command in your command prompt or system console:

node survey.mjs

The server will start and you will see this pop up:
Server is running at http://localhost:8000
